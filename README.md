To facilitate metric analysis of the LSST OpSim outputs, NOIRLab's Community Science \& Data Centre (CSDC) provides the LSST MAF software packages and simulations outputs to their Astro Data Lab science platform. As this is the most straightforward way to access LSST MAF software packages and simulations outputs, we recommend using Astro Data Lab https://datalab.noirlab.edu/ to run the code.
However, users without access to Astro Data Lab can run the metrics by following the installation instructions provided \footnote{https://www.lsst.org/scientists/simulations/maf} and download the simulations from \url{http://astro-lsst-01.astro.washington.edu:8081/}.
